<p>Life is easy with technology coming into our life. Calls just a few taps away; streaming anytime, anywhere; ready food delivery at your helm with a few clicks; managing and counting calories on the go and so the list goes…</p>



<p>From the basic health apps on our phone, we moved to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.boat-lifestyle.com/collections/smart-watches">smart watches</a>&nbsp;tracking our steps to specialised workout based tracking.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And here comes the big “BUT”.</p>



<p>What about everything in between? Like every nice piece of technology, Watch Xtend Sport — our all new fitness watch will have a fitness tracker like no other. This best smartwatch under 3000 tracks your regular sports, your step count, your calorie burnt and goes beyond to with its 700+ activity modes.</p>



<p>While a regular fitness watch may activate a specific mode to a very limited number of sports, Xtend Sport watches out your calorie burnt even while binge watching your favourite series, or while snuggling, rapping, performing ballet and while performing household chores. So what can our best fitness watch do? Here is a little list to ease things up for you.</p>
